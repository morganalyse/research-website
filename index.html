<p>The date was April 3, 1973, forty years ago a Motorola exec made what is considered an idea to be the initial call on what we would recognize now as the first truly mobile phone. DynaTAC was a merged acronym for Dynamic Adaptive Total Area Coverage. He used it to call a rival. It was the first commercially-available mobile phone, costing about $4,000 U.S. This mobile phone could also hold up to 30 minutes of available talking time. There are many different things to describe this cellphone. It weighed about 784g and it was not touchscreen, the dimensions were 3300 x 898 x 445mm, and its volume was .1318710 cm3. When wanting to recharge it costed $3,995 and it took as long as 10 hours. It was also the first to carry a phone call over the regular phone system. But the first true cellular call was also made on a Motorola DynaTAC — to an Ameritech Mobile exec named Bob Barnett in 1983.

Originally as you see today we have created the Iphone10, soon be an iPhone 11. So let’s go back to 2007. The first ever “IPhone”, known as the Iphone1. Famous inventor Steven P. Jobs introduced this apple product to the world on January 9th of 2007. Featuring a new input technology called “Multi-Touch” the iPhone features only one physical button, called “home.” You control the phone by sliding a finger across its touch-sensitive 3.5-inch display, which has a resolution of 320-by-480 pixels at 160 pixels-per-inch display. This phone also introduced many apps and data to the world. For example, photo, contacts, notes, safari, music and videos, etc. Despite the phone’s features, he said that the phone’s strongest feature was its improvement of how calls are made. An easy use of call feature lets users connect calls with touch of the screen. The iPhone came in two different versions: a 4GB, which was $499 and an 8GB, which was $599. Both required a two-year contract with your exclusive U.S. carrier.
